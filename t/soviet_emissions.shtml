    <h3>Revisiting Soviet emissions of CO<span class="subb">2</span> during WWII</span></h3>
	<p style="font-size: 10pt">First published: 3 February 2020 (expanded from this <a href="https://twitter.com/robbie_andrew/status/1155791085689606145" target="_blank">twitter thread</a>).</p>
	<div class="abstract">

	<p>On the eve of World War II, the Soviet Union was the fourth-largest coal producer in the world, after the USA, Germany, and Britain. But coal production dropped considerably during the war. In this piece I'll discuss why that happened, how much data are actually available, where current estimates of Soviet CO<span class="subb">2</span> emissions during that period come from, and make some revisions to these.</p>

	<p>Soviet production of coal crashed during WWII. It appears this was largely a result of the German invasion of Ukraine in 1941. The invasion of the Soviet Union was motivated both by ideology and economics, and Ukraine "was expected to be both a giant breadbasket and a reservoir of essential minerals" (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0008938915000059" target="_blank">source</a>).</p>
	
	<p>The largest source of Soviet coal was in the industrial Donetsk region, and the city of Donetsk was almost completely destroyed and depopulated.</p>
	
	<p>Kim Christian Priemel <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0008938915000059" target="_blank">describes</a> how surprised the Germans were, when they arrived, to discover how fast the Soviets had progressed in building up the industry of the Eastern Ukraine, compared to the plans they had seen.</p>
	
    <p>But according to Priemel, much of the industrial destruction in Donetsk was done by the Soviets under a scorched-earth policy, and the Germans encountered "complete devastation and emptiness". "In late June [1942], Hitler [ordered] the reconstruction of the Donbas coal mines." The repair of destroyed Zaporizhzhya hydroelectric dam allowed pumping out of flooded mines. But in Sept 1943 the Red Army arrived again, and the Germans repeated the same Scorched Earth policy. In the two years of German occupation of the area, the Germans managed to produce "slightly more than four million tons [of coal] - some 5 percent of Soviet prewar production."</p>

	<p>During this period, Soviet emissions of CO<span class="subb">2</span> were dominated by combustion of coal. But while we see a significant dip in emissions from coal in 1942, there's a sharp increase again in 1943, when we would expect from the foregoing discussion that coal production would be limited.</p>

	<br>

	<p>There aren't many datasets that provide estimates of emissions in the Soviet Union during the Second World War. CDIAC is one, derived from the work of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1600-0889.1999.t01-3-00002.x" target="_blank">Andres et al. (1999)</a>, and these emissions are used in turn by the Global Carbon Project (GCP) and the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS). Andres et al based their estimates primarily on the energy production data reported by Etemad and Luciani (1991; hereafter EL91), adjusted using international trade data from Mitchell (various years; see <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1600-0889.1999.t01-3-00002.x" target="_blank">Andres et al. (1999)</a>).</p>
	
	<p><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2014.10.030" target="_blank">Mohr et al. (2015)</a> also produced estimates, going back to original energy data sources, although while they provide the detailed energy data, they don't provide the emissions estimates.</p>
	
	<p>In the following figure I plot Soviet CO<span class="subb">2</span> emissions from coal directly from CDIAC, and using approximate energy-to-emissions factors for both Mohr and EL91. Given that I'm using approximate factors, and not adjusting Mohr or EL91 for international trade, we wouldn't expect exact matches, but the numbers are very close nonetheless.</p>
	
	<p>We can clearly see that CDIAC's emissions follow closely the data from EL91 during the war years, with a minimum in 1942, a sharp increase in 1943, before another dip in 1944. In contrast, by examining Mohr's reported energy data it's clear that they have linearly interpolated between 1940 and 1945, and their estimates for 1941-1944 are therefore of little value.</p>

	<br>

	<p>As shown in the following figure, EL91 (the source used by Andres) does not report production of either brown coal or peat during the war years, and these are not marked as zero, but as unknown.</p>
	
	<p>Further, EL91's reported Soviet coal production during WWII appears to be estimated, with rounded figures compared with more precise figures in other years. For example, for 1942 they report hard coal production as 90.000 million tonnes, while in 1940 it was 139.974 million tonnes.</p>
	
	<p>We can therefore conclude that the data from EL91 for 1941-1944 are unreliable and incomplete and we should look for other sources.</p>

	<br>
	
	<p>I've located two additional Soviet data sources. The first is "<a href="http://istmat.info/node/350" target="_blank">The national economy of the USSR in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945 (Statistical compilation)</a>" apparently published in 1990 by the Moscow Information and Publishing Center (hereafter PW). Chapter 4 presents data tables of the fuel industry, with production by year for 1940-1945.</p>

	<br>
	
	<p>The second is the "<a href="http://istmat.info/node/40054" target="_blank">Statistical time series for the years 1913-1951</a>" available at the RSAE archive (f. 1562, op. 41, d. 65; hereafter RSAE). This report, marked 'Top secret' and later 'Declassified', has no author or publication date indicated.</p>

	<div><a href="t/i/RSAE_p67.jpg"><img style="margin-left:16%; margin-right:16%" src="t/i/RSAE_p67.jpg" width="25%"></a><a href="t/i/RSAE_p310.jpg"><img style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto" src="t/i/RSAE_p310.jpg" width="25%"></a></div>

	<p>Soviet production of coal crashed during WWII. It appears this was largely a result of the German invasion of Ukraine in 1941. The largest source of Soviet coal was in the industrial Donetsk region, and the city of Donetsk was almost completely destroyed and depopulated. The following bar chart combines information from two tables in RSAE. Production by coal basin are from page 67 while the empty bars representing total production are from page 310.</p>
	<p>The German armed forces didn't drive Soviet troops out of Eastern Ukraine until September 1941, so perhaps coal production could have been maintained through much of 1941. While these are Soviet statistics and therefore most likely only show production by the Soviets, rather than production in all Soviet territory, we recall the abovementioned information that peak German coal production was only 5% of pre-war production, so these are likely very close to full production in the entire territory, including that occupied by the Germans.</p>
	
	<div><a href="t/i/USSR_coal3.png"><img style="margin:0" src="t/i/USSR_coal3.png" width="100%"></a></div>
	<br>
	
	<p>RSAE and PW, the two Soviet data sources, agree precisely on total coal production for each year 1940-1945. The source used by CDIAC, EL91, agrees with RSAE precisely for years up to 1940 and from 1945, but it does not report production of brown coal or peat during 1941-1944. Moreover, EL91 reports production of hard coal that is greater that the Soviet reports of total coal during 1941-1944, while matching exactly outside of that period.</p>
	<div><a href="t/i/USSR_coal4.png"><img style="margin:0" src="t/i/USSR_coal4.png" width="100%"></a></div>
	<br>	
	
	<p>Using these new data, I plot Soviet CO<span class="subb">2</span> emissions from coal below. Here we can see that the largest deviations are in 1942 and 1943, as expected. Deviations from CDIAC in other years are because of adjustments for trade, which can be assumed to be negligible during 1942-43. It seems sensible then to keep CDIAC's emissions time series except for the two data points for 1942 and 1943, which are adjusted significantly downward.</p>
	<div><a href="t/i/USSR_coal1.png"><img style="margin:0" src="t/i/USSR_coal1.png" width="100%"></a></div>
	<br>

	<p>How reliable are these statistics? Rather than tinkering with statistics, <a href="https://jstor.org/stable/2685494" target="_blank">this article</a> argues Soviets mostly simply kept statistics secret if they were either sensitive or negative. The report I've used for coal production has "—Œ¬. —≈ –≈“" on the cover ("Soviet Secret") with "–¿——≈ –≈◊≈ÕŒ" stamped next to that ("Declassified"). While I can't be entirely certain these are accurate statistics, I've shown that the statistics previously used during this period are not accurate, and the new statistics agree with historical evidence about the occupation of Ukraine during the war.</p>

	
	<p>Why am I looking at this? It's important to know what historical CO<span class="subb">2</span> emissions were to improve our understanding of the global carbon cycle. In the 1940s we have a mismatch between known CO<span class="subb">2</span> sources and sinks, called the Budget Imbalance.</p>
	<p>However, the budget imbalance during 1942-43 is over 3 Gt CO<span class="subb">2</span>/yr, and the adjustment here to Soviet emissions is in the order of 100 Mt/yr, so does little to explain the global gap.</p>
