	<p>The amount of soy imported to Norway has grown substantially over the last 20 or so years. Most imports are by <a href="http://www.denofa.com/" target="_blank">Denofa</a> in Fredrikstad and by the aquaculture feed manufacturers. Denofa imports soybeans, extracts the oil and lecithin, exporting most of these, and sells the remaining meal to livestock feed manufacturers both in Norway and abroad.</p>
	<p>The aquaculture feed industry imports soy protein concentrate directly after having found in early research that the 'anti-nutrients' in soy led to poor health outcomes for the fish. The protein concentrate (which is about 65% protein) does not contain these anti-nutrients.</p>
	<p>In the livestock industry, the growth in the use of soy was <a href="https://www.felleskjopet.no/om-felleskjopet/barekraftig-landbruk-soya-og-palmeolje/fakta-om-soya/" target="_blank">initially driven</a> by the Europe-wide requirement after mad cow disease to cease feeding bonemeal and fishmeal to livestock. In the aquaculture industry, the focus has been on reducing the reliance on fishmeal, which is a much more limited resource. In 1990 the fish content of feed <a href="https://nofima.no/en/nyhet/2014/11/have-exceeded-70-per-cent-plant-material-in-salmon-feed/" target="_blank">was 90%</a> but is now below 30%.</p>

	<p>The large majority of soy is imported from Brazil, although this share has declined in the last few years, with growing shares from Canada and Russia. There are of course concerns about deforestation associated with Brazilian soybean production, although the industry here claims their origin certification schemes put those concerns to rest. That <a href="https://www.regnskog.no/no/om-regnskogfondet/dette-mener-regnskogfondet/dette-mener-regnskogfondet-om-soya/problemet-med-soya" target="_blank">remains debatable</a>.</p>

	<h4 id="protein">We must make use of our grass</h4>
	<p>"Norway must make use of its resources in a way that secures sufficient food production."</p>
	<p>In 2017, about 60% of ingredients used in feed concentrate were produced in Norway, but protein is heavily dependent on imported ingredients such as soy, rapeseed, and maize.</p>
	<p>(The data split between imported and domestically produced vitamins and minerals has been incorrect in some years, and is expected to be about half and half, with limestone being produced in Norway.)</p>
	<div><a onClick="trackPNG('JB_4');" href="t/i/jb/kraftfor_origin.png"><img style="margin:0" src="t/i/jb/kraftfor_origin.png" width="100%"></a></div></br>

	<p>Protein is the ingredient that has increased the most in Norwegian livestock feed, and this growth is primarily from rapeseed pellets, while the soya content has been largely stable in recent years. Fish protein has declined considerably.</p>
	<p>It's unfortunate that these data start in 2001, since that year marks the end of the growth in the use of soy for livestock.</p>
	<div><a onClick="trackPNG('JB_5');" href="t/i/jb/kraftfor_protein.png"><img style="margin:0" src="t/i/jb/kraftfor_protein.png" width="100%"></a></div></br>
	
	<p>These protein sources are not 100% protein. Of the three most important protein sources, maize gluten is 60% protein, soy meal 46%, and rapeseed meal 35% (<a href="https://lovdata.no/dokument/SF/forskrift/2009-06-30-954#PARAGRAF_6" target="_blank">source</a>).
	<p>That means that in 2017, of the 446 thousand tonnes of protein sources fed to livestock, about 188 thousand tonnes was actually protein.</p>
	<p>If we divide this by the number of people in Norway, then that's equivalent to 99 grams of protein per person per day, just from the specific protein ingredients in kraftfôr. About 95% of this protein is imported, giving about 94 grams.</p>
	<p>A minimum of 20% of the carbohydrates are also imported, and they have perhaps 12% average protein content, adding 18 grams of imported protein in a year of good Norwegian grain production. So about 112 grams of imported protein per person per day is fed to Norwegian livestock.</p>
	<p>We can now compare this with how much protein Norwegians actually eat, specifically protein from animal livestock sources.</p>
	<p>According to Helsedirektoratet, Norwegians eat an average of <a href="https://helsedirektoratet.no/Lists/Publikasjoner/Attachments/1429/Utviklingen-i-norsk-kosthold-2017-matforsyningsstatistikk-IS-2703.pdf#page=85" target="_blank">79 grams</a> of protein per person per day (net), of which <a href="https://helsedirektoratet.no/Lists/Publikasjoner/Attachments/1429/Utviklingen-i-norsk-kosthold-2017-matforsyningsstatistikk-IS-2703.pdf#page=90" target="_blank">about 56%</a> is from animal livestock (meat, eggs, milk and milk products, but excluding fish).</p>
	<p>That means we obtain about 44 grams of protein per person per day from animal products, excluding fish, while we feed about 112 grams of imported protein (in addition to lots of Norwegian grass and grain) to livestock per person per day. Put another way, for every 100g of protein derived from livestock, about 250g of plant protein was imported to feed those livestock.</p>
	<div><a onClick="trackPNG('JB_5');" href="t/i/jb/protein_balance.png"><img style="margin:0" src="t/i/jb/protein_balance.png" width="100%"></a></div></br>
	<p>[Some of those 44g come from imported meats and cheeses, but similarly some of the meat production is exported. These are both small and likely to almost cancel each other out. There is also an 'other' food category, which may supply a little additional livestock-derived protein.]</p>
	<p>According to <a href="https://www.felleskjopet.no/kraftfor/artikler/slik-er-innholdet-i-felleskjopets-kraftfor/" target="_blank">Felleskjøpet</a>, feed for dairy cows has a higher proportion of imported protein than the feed for pigs and poultry. Feed for dairy cows is 19&ndash;27% imported soy and rapeseed by mass. This compares to less than 15% for pigs, 12&ndash;17% for laying hens, and 21&ndash;23% for broilers.</p>
	<p>The reason for such high protein levels in the feed of dairy cows is precisely to increase production of milk. According to Harald Volden, an adviser at Tine, relying only on Norwegian protein sources (mainly grass) would lead to a <a href="https://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/debatt/i/9QMr/Melker-norske-kyr-soyamelk" target="_blank">decline</a> of milk production per cow by 15&ndash;20%.</p>
	<p>In essence the logic is as follows: Norway should be as self-sufficient in protein production as possible, but because much of the land can produce no more than grass, and because only ruminants like sheep and cattle can turn that grass into protein, we must have lots of sheep and cattle. Once we agree that we should have sheep and cattle, we should increase their productivity by importing large amounts of protein from overseas. Increasing their productivity, particularly dairy cattle, means we don't need as many of them. In the process we've forgotten that the point of having sheep and cattle was to be self-sufficient in protein.</p>
	<p>Meanwhile, the plant protein that Norway can produce, largely grains, are mostly fed to livestock.</p>
	<p>Has Norway decided that it is acceptable to rely on imported protein (and other critical components of nutrition) or not?</p>
	<p>There are other arguments for having sheep and cattle in Norway, including the strong desires to (1) maintain the cultural landscape, (2) maintain regional employment in traditional activities, (3) consume meat and dairy products. These seem like perfectly reasonable arguments, without needing to add in additional, spurious ones.</p>
	<p>While there remain reasonable arguments for maintaining sheep and cattle production in Norway, there are also reasonable arguments against it, including the need to address climate change. It is the role of government to balance these conflicting policy areas.</p>

	<h4 id="transport">Transport of soy over long distances</h4>
	<p>It is often assumed that the transportation of Norway's imported feed ingredients over large distances requires enormous amounts of energy and results in significant greenhouse gas emissions. As we've seen, almost all of the soy that Norway imports comes from Brazil, a journey of over 10,000 kilometres by ship.</p>
	<p>But this simply isn't the case. The figure below shows my estimates of emissions from the transport by ship of all soy imported to Norway. This excludes any trucking within countries and focuses therefore on the consequences of the very large distances involved.</p>
	<p>I've used shipping distances from <a href="http://www.portworld.com/map" target="_blank">Portworld</a>, and emission factors from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/government-conversion-factors-for-company-reporting" target="_blank">DEFRA</a>.</p>
	<p>Imports of some 800,000 tonnes of soy per year, most of which travels over 10,000 km to get here, result in emissions of a little over 50 thousand tonnes of CO<span class="subb">2</span>, equivalent to about 0.1% of Norway's territorial emissions, which are <a href="https://www.ssb.no/natur-og-miljo/statistikker/klimagassn/aar-endelige" target="_blank">over 50 million tonnes per year</a>.</p>
	<p>When we look only at the soy that is used to feed livestock &ndash; about a quarter of the total imports by weight &ndash; the emissions from Norwegian farmers' own use of diesel on their farms are about 25 times higher than the emissions resulting from transporting this soy across the world.</p>
	<p>How can this be? Simple: Long-distance transportation by ship is extremely efficient. While there are many very important issues to consider about Norway's import of so much soy, the distance travelled is not one of them. We have bigger fish to fry.</p>
