    <h3>Norway's CO<span class="subb">2</span> in 2019: Some early pointers</span></h3>
	<p style="font-size: 10pt">First published: 5 December 2019.</p>
	<div class="abstract">
	<p>With 2019 almost over, we already have a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-50648495" target="_blank">projection of global CO<span class="subb">2</span> emissions</a> this year. But with a good wait before we have official preliminary estimates of CO<span class="subb">2</span> emissions in Norway, what can we say at this point about what 2019's emissions might look like?</p>
	<p>Here I'll look briefly at some partial-year data that could give us some pointers, although certainly not the whole answer. When SSB release preliminary estimates of 2019 emissions around the start of June 2020, they will have access to an enormous wealth of data that aren't available publicly. They're also much more careful than I'll be here...</p>
	<p>We can't get partial estimates for all sources of emissions in Norway, being constrained by publicly available data. But what do we have?</p>
	<p>We know that transport, oil and gas production, and oil refining are some of the largest sources of CO<span class="subb">2</span> emissions in Norway, so it seems sensible to start there.</p>
	<h4>Fuel sales</h4>
	<p>First off, SSB releases monthly statistics on the <a href="https://www.ssb.no/statbank/table/11174/" target="_blank">sales of fuel</a>. Here I pick out three important fuel types, and data available right now run through October.</p>
	<p>Road Diesel sales are down 3.3% compared to the same period last year. We can see that there was strong growth in sales of road diesel through 2016, but since then sales have slowly declined, and this year's decline is larger. Importantly, these statistics do not differentiate between fossil and biodiesel, so any changes in the fraction of biodiesel do not affect the growth rates shown here, so we can't use that as an explanation for the changes. If biodiesel sales are higher this year than last, something that could be expected, then the decline in fossil road diesel sales will be even larger than 3.3% through October. Unfortunately statistics on sales of biofuels on not available until almost half-way through the following year.</p>
	<p>Sales of Petrol have been declining for years, a result of the grand transition from petrol to diesel passenger vehicles in Norway and many other European countries. This transition has come to an unnatural conclusion with the Diesel Cheating scandal demonstrating that diesel cars didn't stack up quite as we'd thought environmentally. But the decline of petrol sales so far this year is stronger than we've seen for six years. Unlike diesel, there's little biofuel blended in with petrol.</p>
	<p>Lastly, sales of Construction Diesel are quite volatile from year to year, last year jumping 8.6%, but this year so far down 1.4%.</p>

	<h4>Production of oil and gas</h4>
	<p>The extaction of oil and gas in Norway requires a lot of energy, largely in the form of natural gas running turbines. The public part of the <a href="https://www.npd.no/om-oss/organisasjon/samarbeidsfora/diskos/" target="_blank">Diskos National Data Repository</a> provides monthly statistics on the use of natural gas on the platforms and at land terminals.</p>
	<p>The historical data show that interannual growth is quite variable. With data through September this year, natural gas consumption is down 1.0%.</p>
	<div><a href="t/i/fueluse_growth_191204.png"><img style="margin:0" src="t/i/fueluse_growth_191204.png" width="100%"></a></div>
	<br>


	<h4>Domestic flights</h4>
	<p>With international flights excluded from Norway's emissions reporting, we look here at domestic flights, using data <a href="https://avinor.no/konsern/om-oss/trafikkstatistikk/trafikkstatistikk" target="_blank">provided by Avinor</a>. While they have reported passenger numbers through their own airports as well as the few others here in Norway, this dual reporting was recently interrupted, so that data through October only cover Avinor's airports.</p>
	<p>Most years in the series show growth, with the exception of 2015, possibly a result of the effects in Norway of the drop in the price of oil. But this year so far passenger numbers are down 1.2%. I haven't found any explanations for this drop, but two possibilities could be the Greta-effect, although this is clearly <a href="https://www.nettavisen.no/okonomi/sjokktall-for-svensk-flytrafikk---dette-er-veldig-uvanlig/3423857662.html" target="_blank">much stronger in Sweden</a>, or perhaps a consequence of the struggles of airline Norwegian, which has substantially <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/norwegian-air-traffic/update-1-norwegian-air-slashed-november-traffic-to-stem-losses-idUSL8N28F0YR" target="_blank">reduced capacity this year</a>.</p>
	<div><a href="t/i/avinor_domestic_abs_191204.png"><img style="margin:0" src="t/i/avinor_domestic_abs_191204.png" width="100%"></a></div>
	<br>


	<h4>Oil refining</h4>
	<p>For oil refining we have SSB's industry <a href="https://www.ssb.no/pii" target="_blank">production index</a>, which is a measure of physical output or hours worked often used as a proxy for economic activity in these industries.</p>
	<p>Norway refines much more oil than it uses domestically, with the surplus exported to other countries.</p>
	<p>The data here through September show a decline by 3.0% compared to the same period last year, a larger decline than in 2018, and quite a turnaround from the substantial growth in 2015-2017.</p>
	<div><a href="t/i/refining.png"><img style="margin:0" src="t/i/refining.png" width="100%"></a></div>
	<br>
	
	<h4>In sum?</h4>
	<p>It's very difficult to say from these data what we'll see in SSB's first preliminary release on Norway's CO<span class="subb">2</span> emissions, expected around the start of June 2020. And this is a very cursory analysis, without looking at how well the chosen indicators actually represent annual emissions (something for 'future work', as we scientists like to say).</p>
	<p>But the signs here are for a slight decline in emissions. If we also have a return to growth in the fraction of biodiesel after <a href="https://twitter.com/robbie_andrew/status/1135513691607228416" target="_blank">2018's palm-oil pushback</a>, then that will contribute further.</p>
	<p>This is all very back-of-the-envelope, and only indicative using what data there is publicaly available, but it's nevertheless interesting to see what's happening so far this year. And since we have frequent updates of economic activity published to great attention, why not also frequent environmental updates? Imagine if every time GDP was updated, we also had updates on environmental indicators?</p>
