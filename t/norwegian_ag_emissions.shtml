	<p>Emissions from Norwegian agriculture have gone down by 11% since 1990. While this fact has been widely reported, the reasons behind that drop are not so well known. What's more, the emission numbers for agriculture usually exclude activities that are clearly part of the agricultural sector: heating of glasshouses, on-farm use of diesel, and cultivation of drained wetlands. However, even when these additional sources of emissions are included, the total for the agricultural sector coincidentally still went down about 11% since 1990.</p>

	<p>The figure below shows how different sources of emissions in the agricultural sector have changed since 1990. What's evident at a glance is that cultivation of drained wetlands ('organic soils' or 'dyrket myr') is a large and fairly stable share of the total. Normally when plants die, the dead material is rapidly decomposed by bacteria, fungi, and others, but when the dead plant material is submerged under water, only much less efficient anaerobic bacteria are involved. This means that carbon builds up over time in the soil, reaching very high levels. (This explains why peat is such a good energy source.) But when these wetlands are drained, and especially when they are ploughed, the carbon-rich soil becomes exposed to the air, allowing decomposition to proceed at a rapid pace. With such a lot of carbon to get through, this process goes on for many years, releasing a lot of carbon dioxide into the air.</p>

	<p>Organic soils account for only 7% of Norway's cropland, but contribute more than 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions. One of the measures in the Budget agreed by the coalition parties was to restore some organic soils back to wetlands, but the amount is very small: 26 million kroner and 0.016 MtCO2e. However, Norway needs more experience in restoration of wetlands, and it is difficult to see how large areas of cultivated organic soils could be taken out of production. Most important is to stop new drainage of wetlands, and Parliament has asked the Government to consider this.</p>

	<p>Also clear in this figure is that emissions from agriculture overall have gone down. The largest decline (about 350 kt) is in the emissions of methane from the digestive systems of cattle: enteric fermentation (fordøyelsesgass). The reason these emissions have gone down is almost entirely because the number of cattle has gone down (see second figure, below). Indeed, the number of mature dairy cows in Norway dropped by almost 50% over this period. Why? In line with declining milk consumption, production has dropped by 20%. Meanwhile, the yield of milk per cow has increased by more than 20%, largely because of more efficient feed. The combination of these two drivers means that only a little over half as many cows are required to meet Norway's current demand for milk. But then why didn't the emissions from cattle drop by almost half? Because the consumption of beef is about the same now as it was in 1990, and with a significant reduction in the number of dairy cows to meet that demand, Norway's beef cattle industry has grown by almost a factor of ten. Emissions from these new cattle partly offset the reduced emissions in the dairy industry.</p>

	<p>Apart from this change in the dairy industry, the largest drop in emissions occurs in the 'other' category (see first figure again). The main reason for this is the inclusion into this category of uptake of carbon by agricultural soils: negative emissions. The amount of CO2 absorbed by agricultural soils (both under crops and grass) since 1990 has increased significantly. But here we must be cautious. This absorption of carbon occurs almost entirely in the first year after conversion from forestry, and thereafter mineral soils are approximately in equilibrium. Effectively, the only reason for this 'improvement' in emissions in this category is because of conversion of forestry to agriculture, something that is not sustainable, and reduces the amount of carbon that forestry might otherwise absorb from the atmosphere.</p>

	<p>There are other achievements, including a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from the glasshouse industry, about 60% down compared to 1990 because they now use cleaner fuels. Also Norwegian farmers are using significantly less lime (calcium carbonates) on their soils, resulting in a drop in emissions of more than 60% from that source.</p>

	<p>But most categories of emissions in the agricultural sector have been stable over these 25 years. The Norwegian government has been tasking experts with how emissions in the agricultural sector could be reduced, and several solid reports have already been produced (e.g. <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/416c222bde624f938710ff36751ef4d6/rapport-landbruk-og-klimaendringer---rapport-fra-arbeidsgruppe-190216.pdf#86">this one</a>). Measures include reducing food waste, shifting some consumption from red meat to white meat, ending the new cultivation of wetlands, production of biogas, biochar, improved drainage of mineral soils, and restoration of cultivated wetlands.</p>
