	<p>We've been telling the public for years to change their lightbulbs, and this has been very successful. This is what is known as a win-win: a win both for the environment and for the wallet. The newer types of lightbulbs, fluorescents and especially LEDs, are much more efficient than the old, incandescent ones. Householders, by changing their lightbulbs, use less energy and save money.</p>
	
	<p>Of course, the message is simple: just replace your existing old-style bulbs for the new models. It should be nuanced: do this when your existing bulbs reach the ends of their lives. Without that nuance in the messaging, we use more resources than we need to.</p>
	
	<p>But while the lightbulb story is a good example of a successful intervention, with there being few reasons for householders not to implement it, the environmental benefit is very small. This raises some important questions: Are the only examples of win-win solutions those with very small environmental benefits? How large is the environmental virtue glow ('rebound') effect, where consumers, feeling they've done something good, now allow themselves to do something bad, without realising that the bad far outweighs the good?</p>
