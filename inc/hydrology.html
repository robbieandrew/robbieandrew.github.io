        <p>How does changing land use affect the hydrology of a catchment? In this work, Robbie Andrew and John Dymond construct a reduced-complexity mechanistic model and apply it at high spatial resolution to investigate the consequences of changing patterns of forest and agriculture. <a href="learnmore/more_hydrology.shtml" class="readmore">Learn more &raquo;</a></p>
