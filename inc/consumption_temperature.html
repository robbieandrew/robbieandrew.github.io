        <p>In this article Jonas Karstensen and colleagues investigate the effects of consumption on global temperature change. While many studies focus on the well-mixed GHGs (CO<span class="subb">2</span>, CH<span class="subb">4</span>, etc.), this study includes also the so-called short-lived climate forcers such as SO<span class="subb">2</span> and BC. This extended framing provides a clearer picture of the climate consequences of policy.<a href="learnmore/more_consumption_temperature.shtml" class="readmore">Learn more &raquo;</a></p>
