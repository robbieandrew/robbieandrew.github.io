        <p>Because of the cost and perceived difficulty of using full multi-regional input&ndash;output (MRIO) models to calculate emissions embodied in international trade, many researchers use simpler approaches, making key assumptions and approximations. In this study, Robbie Andrew and colleagues investigate the effects of these approximations and provide advice on their use. <a href="learnmore/more_approxMRIO.shtml" class="readmore">Learn more &raquo;</a></p>
