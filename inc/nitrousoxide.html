        <p>Emissions of nitrous oxide from soil are notoriously difficult to measure and model because they depend on soil characteristics that are highly variable in both time and space. In this work, Surinder Saggar, Robbie Andrew and colleagues present work aimed at reducing these uncertainties. <a href="learnmore/more_nitrousoxide.shtml" class="readmore">Learn more &raquo;</a></p>
