	<h2 id="oilgas">The oil and gas sector</h2>
	<p class="p">There are dozens of facilities in Norway's oil and gas sector. Here I discuss the reasons for changes in emissions in 2024 for the sites whose changes were in the top ten in absolute terms.</p>
	
	<h3>Åsgard: -111 kt CO<sub>2</sub></h3>
	<p class="p">Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> at Åsgard declined by 111.0 kt to reach 605.9 kt in 2024 (-15.5%). This decline was due to planned maintenance for about four weeks in August and September of 2024, along with the permanent closure of the platform's amine plant. Amine is used to strip excess CO<sub>2</sub> from natural gas, and the process requires energy to release the captured CO<sub>2</sub> from the amine again. The CO<sub>2</sub> was then vented to the atmosphere. This processing has now shifted to Kårstø and vented CO<sub>2</sub> has dropped zero at Heimdal at the same time as less natural gas is used to generate the energy required.</p>

    </div>
	
	<h3>Ekofisk: +107 kt CO<sub>2</sub></h3>
	<p class="p">Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> at Ekofisk rose by 107.2 kt (18.7%) in 2024 to reach 681.7 kt. This increase was due to greater use of natural gas to generate electricity. However, the production at the site actually declined in 2024, and the reason for the increase in electricity generation was the new field Tommeliten A, which is connected to the Ekofisk platform. "In October 2023 the Tommeliten A field started production. This is a new seafloor construction with tie-in to the Ekofisk field. Production boring began at the end of September 2022 and was complete in the first quarter of 2024" [<a href="https://www.offshorenorge.no/contentassets/39dda802fe004804bdfd32121e6a7c4b/ekofisk-2024.pdf">source</a>].</p>

	<h3>Troll: -91 kt CO<sub>2</sub></h3>
	<p class="p">Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> at Troll declined by 90.5 kt (15.6%) in 2024, largely due to partial electrification, which occurred in April of 2024. The platforms are now connected to the mainland grid via a 132 kV subsea power cable to Kollsnes, northwest of Bergen [<a href="https://www.equinor.com/news/20240911-reducing-emissions-troll-field">source</a>].</p>

    </div>
	
	<h3>Heimdal: -75 kt CO<sub>2</sub></h3>
	<p class="p">Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> at Heimdal declined by 75.1 kt (-100%) in 2024. Heimdal produced natural gas and some oil until June 2020, but continued to operate as a gas-processing centre until the middle of 2023. At that point the ageing infrastructure and increased maintenance led to the final shut down of the platform, and gas processing was rerouted to Kvitebjørn. Heimdal was "a hub for dry gas transport from Oseberg, in addition to processing production from fields such as Atla, Skirne, Vale, Valemon and Huldra" [<a href="https://factpages.sodir.no/en/field/TableView/Description">source</a>] </p>

	<h3>Sleipner Øst: -57 kt CO<sub>2</sub></h3>
	<p class="p">Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> at Sleipner Øst declined by 57.5 kt (-13.2%) in 2024, to reach 379.0 kt. The platform was partially electrification in September 2024. Power from the shore is supplied via the Gina Krog platform [<a href="https://factpages.sodir.no/en/field/PageView/All/43478">source</a>].</p>

    </div>

	<h3>Norne: -57 kt CO<sub>2</sub></h3>
	<p class="p">Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> at Norne declined by 56.7 kt (21.7%) to reach 204.6 kt in 2024. This field is in its decline phase, nearing the end of its productive life, and production of natural gas dropped by 62% in 2024.</p>

	<h3>Melkøya: -56 kt CO<sub>2</sub></h3>
	<p class="p">Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> at Melkøya declined by 56.5 kt (6.0%) to reach 891.9 kt in 2024. The reason is unclear, with production of LNG actually increasing in 2024. There is a clear, steady decline through 2024 in emissions from the use of natural gas to generate electricity at the plant.</p>

    </div>

	<h3>Gina Krog: -55 kt CO<sub>2</sub></h3>
	<p class="p">Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> at Gina Krog declined by 55.4 kt (85.4%), reaching 9.5 kt. The platform was connected to power from the short in September 2023, resulting in a considerable drop in the use of natural gas in turbines. In addition, the floating storage and offloading (FSO) unit - basically a ship that transfers oil off the platform - was replaced with a dedicated oil pipline in October 2024. The replacement of this stationary ship led to reduced use of both natural gas and diesel at the site.</p>

	<h3>Kårstø: -46 kt CO<sub>2</sub></h3>
	<p class="p">Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> at the Kårstø gas-processing facility north of Stavanger declined by 45.7 kt (-6.3%) to reach 681.0 kt in 2024. This decline was largely because of scheduled maintenance in 2024.</p>

	<h3>Aasta Hansteen: +39 kt CO<sub>2</sub></h3>
	<p class="p">Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> at Aasta Hansteen increased by 38.6 kt (19.7%) to reach 234.4 kt in 204. This was largely due to scheduled maintenance that lower emissions in 2023.</p>

	<h2 id="industry">Other industry</h2>
	<p class="p">Norwegian companies report their emissions to the European Union's Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), and these are available as "verified emissions" in early April each year on the European Commission's website [<a href="https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/eu-emissions-trading-system-eu-ets/union-registry_en#fees">link</a>]. Here I discuss the reasons for changes in emissions in selected Norwegian facilities with large changes between 2023 and 2024.</p>
	
	<h3>Elkem Salten: -195 kt CO<sub>2</sub></h3>
	<p class="p">Elkem Salten's silicon smelting facility saw CO<sub>2</sub> emissions decline of 194.6 kt (59%) to reach 133.7 kt in 2024. The cause of this decline in emissions was a fire that broke out on 10 December 2023 and caused very substantial damage. The first smelting oven came back on line in late January 2024 [<a href="https://www.finansavisen.no/industri/2024/01/29/8089080/elkem-starter-en-av-tre-ovner-i-salten">source</a>], and the second in April 2024 [<a href="https://www.roic.ai/quote/ELKEF/transcripts/2024/3">source</a>]. The third oven was very badly damanged and "has to be rebuilt completely" [<a href="https://www.nrk.no/nordland/venter-fortsatt-pa-full-drift-etter-storbrann-1.16869785">source</a>].

	<h3>Tjeldbergodden: -127 kt CO<sub>2</sub></h3>
	<p class="p">Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> at the Tjeldbergodden methanol plant declined by 127.3 kt (61%) to reach 82.9 kt in 2024. The plant underwent its largest ever maintenance work, starting 13 April 2024 and originally schedulated to end 21 July, but continued until late in the year [<a href="https://beerenberg.com/aktuelt/rekordstor-revisjonsstans-paa-tjeldbergodden/">source</a>] [<a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php/?story_fbid=844421904371427&id=100064108747546">source</a>].</p>

	<h3>Yara Porsgrunn: -80 kt CO<sub>2</sub></h3>
	<p class="p">Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> at Yara's ammonia plant in Porsgrunn declined by 79.9 kt (8%) to reach 885.1 kt in 2024. It appears that this was a result of maintenance downtime, but potentially also the start of the green hydrogen facility, which uses Europe's largest electrolyser to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The renewable hydrogen plant was officially opened in June 2024, and is expected to cut 41 kt CO<sub>2</sub> per year [<a href="https://www.yara.com/siteassets/investors/057-reports-and-presentations/annual-reports/2024/yara-integrated-report-2024.pdf">source</a>].</p>

    </div>

	<h3>Ineos Tyssedal: +73 kt CO<sub>2</sub></h3>
	<p class="p">Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> at the Tyssedal titanium plant increased by 72.9 kt (41%) to reach 251.2 kt in 2024. This plant refines ilmenite to produce titanium for the market, using a smelter. The smelting process uses coal for chemical reduction (removal of oxygen). The plant was purchased from Eramet in September 2023 by INEOA. The reason for the increase in emissions in 2024 is a return to more normal levels are very low emissions in 2023. The decline in 2023 was caused by much lower production [<a href="https://www.norskeutslipp.no/no/Diverse/Virksomhet/?CompanyID=5118">source</a>], which in turn was driven by scheduled decadal maintenance in the first half of the year, starting mid-February and lasting "2.5 months" [<a href="https://www.eramet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-05-16-Eramet-Investor-Presentation-May-2023.pdf">source</a>]. But production was also reduced "to limit the impact of rising energy prices", the furnace capacity already having been reduced prior to the maintenance shutdown [<a href="https://www.eramet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-04-27-Eramet-PR-Q1-2023.pdf">source</a>].</p>
